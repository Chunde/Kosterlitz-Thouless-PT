# Kosterlitz-Thouless-PT
2-D XY Model with Monte Carlo method to simulate the KT Phase Transition

Ising.py is for 2-D Ising model in single spin flip with Metropolis method.

SWang.py is for 2-D Ising model in Swendsen Wang method.

KT.py is for 2-D XY model in Swendsen Wang method, and we'll see Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition for the observables.
